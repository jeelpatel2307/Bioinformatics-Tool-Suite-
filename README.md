### Bioinformatics Tool Suite

This Java program implements a basic Bioinformatics Tool Suite that provides functionalities for DNA sequence analysis, transcription, and translation.

### Functionality:

1. **DNA Sequence Analysis:** Calculates the length of the DNA sequence and the percentage of GC content.
2. **Transcription:** Converts a DNA sequence into an RNA sequence by replacing all occurrences of 'T' with 'U'.
3. **Translation:** Translates an RNA sequence into a protein sequence using a codon table mapping RNA codons to amino acids.

### Usage:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the Java file: `javac BioinformaticsToolSuite.java`
3. Run the program: `java BioinformaticsToolSuite`

### Example:

Input DNA Sequence: `ATGCGTACAGCTGACGATCAGCTAGCTAGCT`

Output:

```
DNA Sequence Length: 30
GC Content: 50%
Transcribed RNA Sequence: AUGCGUACAGCUGACGAUCAGCUAGCUAGCU
Translated Protein Sequence: MRSHDST*

```

### Further Customization:

- You can modify the code to handle additional functionalities or improve existing ones.
- Expand the codon table to include more RNA codons and their corresponding amino acids.
- Enhance the user interface for better interaction and visualization of results.
